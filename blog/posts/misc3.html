<p>A lot of people talk about how they want to learn a language, but they don't have the time, or that it seems too difficult; I want to share my experiences until now with learning languages to show that it's not as hard as it looks, and even with a small amount of effort, you only need consistency and some enthusiasm to be able to see impressive results. Learning a language will always take a lot of time, but I'm confident you'll be able to surprise yourself with what you can do even in a short amount of time. </p>
<p>Learning languages can feel embarrassing because talking with other people is already hard as it is, but when you add the constraints of the limited vocabulary you have in new language, perhaps some difficulty with pronunciation, and likely taking much longer to form actual sentences, you can begin to feel like a child among your peers. But really, I think that's a good way of thinking of any skill; without any practice, you might as well be like a young child in terms of that skill. And if that sounds obvious, that's probably because it is: people are almost always incredibly grateful and forgiving when you try to speak their language because they know it's a skill you have to build completely from the ground up. So like with any other skill, put your best childlike attitude forward, and have fun practicing without fear of embarrassment - give it some time, and you'll have built something that you can't wait to show off.</p>
<p>While it's important to recognize language learning's common points with learning any other skill, I also believe it's equally important to distinguish that each language you learn is its own distinct skill. There are things that as someone learns more languages over time, they'll be able to apply past knowledge to learn quicker, but I think that, too, can be true for learning in general, like applying knowledge from one sport to learn another. While some languages share parts of their grammar, similar words, or derive from the same language, every language is a completely new mode of describing your world. That's what makes learning languages so beautiful and fun, and it's also why you shouldn't be discouraged if you feel like you're starting slow. </p>
<p>Another concern a lot of people mention about learning languages is that they're too old to start learning, or that is to say, that they wished they started learning when they were younger. At least, I definitely felt that way for a long time before learning Spanish; a lot of my family speaks Spanish, including my mother, but they never really spoke Spanish with me when I was growing up. For a long time, I felt like that opportunity was taken from me, but now that I've learned enough Spanish to have some confidence speaking it, I feel much different. Now I feel like even if I had learned when I was younger, it would've been just as much work as learning Spanish now as an adult. For sure, some parts would've been easier, for example, automatically immersing myself in the language by talking with my family, but on the other hand, whether for English or Spanish, the younger version of me would have to put much more effort in school and my social skills to learn two languages at the same time. And regardless of the time I started learning Spanish, I certainly still need to put in some effort over the long run to maintain my skills.</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not saying that bilingual learning is bad for kids, to the contrary; it's a privilege to have your learning structured for you in that way, especially when normally you have nothing but spare time as a kid. I'm only trying to say that, whether as an adult or a child, it's hard work to learn a language, but there's also always fun to be had in the process if you let yourself apply your learning to the things you enjoy. In fact, even though it's more difficult to find the time and certain resources to learn a language as an adult, you're completely free to create your own fun process to learn - you can be the teacher that you always wanted for yourself.</p>
<p>Just like any other skill, starting from a young age is an advantage, but it still takes the same amount of time to master that ability. With all of that being said, if another language is important to you for any reason - talking with family or friends, love of another culture, or something else - start now, stay consistent, and most importantly, have fun, and you won't regret it. In that way, maybe this article can be a starting point for you. The greatest truth, about any skill, but especially for learning a language, is that more importantly than how you do it, it will always take a lot of time. Primarily, language learning is a matter of memorization: without a doubt, learning the grammar of a language can help us understand that language more in order to create something new in that language, but if you think about your first language, especially in regard to speaking casually, you're never thinking about any rules or anything else, the words just come out automatically by memory alone. </p>
<p>This is why nothing exists to skip the innumerable hours of practice required to gain fluency, and that same reason is why it's so important to enjoy that practice, no matter how old you are. If we again think of our first language, we can also admit how much we had to work to obtain the level of grammar, vocabulary, and expression that we have in that language today: thousands of hours in school, speaking, with homework, reading, watching television, and so much more. To learn a new language is to repeat this process almost completely, only armed with what we know about languages and expressing ourselves through words on a general level, and if you're lucky, with words, phrases, or grammar that are similar. It's in this way that learning each new language is like learning an entirely new skill: in sports, or even something like chess, you have to practice thousands of hours to master all the techniques and strategies, and for every language you need thousands of hours of immersion to learn every word, element of grammar, and more. </p>
<p>While I can't claim that everything in this article is pure science, I hope that it can inspire some of you to start your journey with learning languages, and that the tools that I want to share here for that purpose can be useful and help you have fun on your journey. It's still true that you can't avoid the many hours of studying to learn a language, but there are tools and methods that can help you to maintain the structure, fun, and consistency needed to reach something like fluency. The same tools can help you make the absolute most of your time if that speaks to you as well, but for many reasons that we'll continue to discuss, each little bit of time saved is not nearly as important as simply staying consistent. In that way, I don't want to focus on the tools and specifics too much, but for me, they've also been a part of the fun of discovering a new language. Like buying new paints that make you want to draw, I think that new and effective tools are almost always fun to use, and the experience with those tools can be very personalized, creating a feeling of pride in knowing that you accomplished something by yourself. But before talking too many details, let me tell you a bit about the start of my own journey. </p>
<p>At first, the only reason that I started learning Spanish was that I wanted to be able to speak with my ex-girfriend's family, but now that I've been able to go through the process of learning a language without anyone else structuring it for me, I've discovered the parts of language learning that I really love, and now I truly enjoy the process in general. Language learning really is something that I believe everyone in the world should try, and also that I love to talk about and share with others. I think that it can give you a new perspective on other parts of the world by seeing the way that those other places communicate and express themselves, how different that can really be, and in the same way it can give you more confidence in how you communicate and learn.</p>
<p>In my own experience with Spanish, I was able to reach the level of basic conversations in about a year. For sure, I think that I had a bit of an initial advantage because I took Spanish classes in school for a decent while, but at the same time, like many students who take compulsory classes for foreign languages, even after a lot of Spanish classes, I had very little confidence in speaking, and I honestly didn't remember much from my classes - at least not any more than you remember any of your other classes from high school. In any case, the purpose of telling you this isn't to boast or to give you a goal for how fast you should try to learn a language, but just to give you an idea of relatively how much time it can take to start feeling more confident in a new language. For someone that has some experience with learning languages, that time frame might sound long or short; the path for everyone is very different, just like with anything else, but I think that the time frame of a year helps describe how language learning is both something that simply takes time, and also something that isn't as gargantuan as an effort as it might seem.</p>
<!-- TODO: pickup revising from here -->
<p>In the time it took me to gain more confidence in my Spanish, I just made sure to practice at least a tiny bit each day; what I achieved each day was actually really easy, and the only challenge was to form and maintain the habit, and even that challenge honestly wasn't so bad. You can make sure that you force yourself to maintain habits for learning the language you want in your life by combining them with existing habits, for example as I mentioned with talking or texting your friends and family in that language. Many other ways are possible: you might have a journal, which you can try to write any part that you can in the language you want to learn. If you like watching YouTube to relax after work, you can try to find someone to watch who's a native speaker of the language that interests you, only using subtitles in that same language. Of course, many of these require some prior learning, but even understanding very basic sentences is enough to start any or all of these habits. It'll be much more difficult at first, and you might feel tempted to think that you're learning too slowly, but I assure you, you're totally fine. Starting to learn something will always seem tougher than learning more of something that you already know, and until you start using that new something in your daily life, it's more likely that you haven't had enough opportunity yet to get past those initial growing pains anyway.</p>
<p>Once these small daily habits are formed, in due time you'll learn a lot faster than with any other schedule. For example, it might seem great to do as much as you can on the weekends; but even with the same amount of total time as practicing a tiny bit each day, this is not only more difficult to stay consistent with, because trying to fit everything in over one or two days can be very unpredictable, but the repetition that your brain gets over a couple of days is much less. If you practice something fifty times just in one session, and you never see that thing again after that, chances are that you'll forget that thing sooner or later. But if you practice the same thing one time every day for fifty days, it's imperative that your brain will have more nights to physically develop your memory of that thing, but also the fact that having to remember that thing every day is like flexing a very beneficial muscle that you wouldn't be able to use in just one session. In that way, distributing your studies like this can effectively double how much you'll remember. We'll talk about a more specific workflow later, but the things I already mentioned, like keeping a journal or watching YouTube in your chosen language, are great ways to maintain a habit of learning constantly.</p>
<p>By this point, I've been able to start learning two languages that I'm really passionate about: first Spanish, of course, and second, Japanese. For both, my reasons for learning them are a mix of being practical and having fun. I already mentioned the practical reason that I started learning Spanish, but the more I learned, the more I realized that I loved to be more in contact with my heritage. Discovering Mexican or Latin American music (and actually understanding it), talking with my family or even strangers in Spanish, or just ordering food in Spanish gives me a feeling of pride, in knowing that I'm gaining access to so much more about myself, my culture, and my family that I totally couldn't understand before. Even just in the light that a language represents a different way for a group of people to describe how they see the world around them, I think that a language is a such a large window into learning about a culture and appreciating what it has to offer. Learning that showed me how much I love to discover things about other languages and other cultures; every language can have radically different ways of expressing yourself, and learning those can reveal aspects of a culture that you can't learn any other way, even for the simpler, smaller, or everyday parts of a culture. </p>
<p>Of course, having cultures that already interested me is something that motivated me a lot in finding a love of discovering other languages and cultures, but I think that genuine interest is another thing that is almost essential for learning anything for an entire lifetime. I can admit that one of the main reasons that I wanted to learn Japanese is my love of many Japanese video games and anime, and the chance to visit Japan while being able to try communicating authentically about those passions, in a way that tries to understand the heart of the culture that made them possible, is something that makes me want to keep learning. There are a lot of chances I could be missing to make new friends who share those passions simply because I don't speak their language, and what better understanding is there of something than by its source? To that end, a popular technique that I discovered a little while ago, called "sentence mining", can make the process of immersing yourself in the culture of another language quite fun. The name is quite literal, where you search or "mine" through any material of your choosing for something that you don't recognize, then take the sentence along with that word, piece of grammar, phrase, or any other concept to give you the context to study and recognize that thing again. While there are many ways to remember these units of a language, "sentence mining", as we'll come to explore, is meant to be an automatic system to truly make it easy (or in other words, consistent), fun, and scientifically structured to stay on track with remember what you learn. </p>
<p>Before I'd learned of sentence mining, I only wanted to use my own methods to learn. I felt justified by my success with learning Spanish, and I had my doubts about sentence mining because I thought it could just be an internet trend. But now that I've tried it for a decent amount of time (for about four months), I can confirm how well it works. I feel like I can verify this even within this short time, because compared to my personal methods from before, I remember so much more of the information that I review. It's obvious that more frequency with something is going to help you to learn it, but there are efficient ways and less informed ways; not all approaches are equal if you want to learn without wasting time. For my own methods, which included simply writing down a word or whatever else when I didn't recognize it, I definitely noticed that only writing something down one time, even with writing it along with a definition, a mnemonic, and in a sentence, I would forget it in about two days, despite all my efforts to make convincing connections to remember it. My logic was to rely on more important words to naturally appear more in my reading or otherwise, and while this has some merit to it, natural and interesting speaking or writing is not something repetitive, and there are many different words to describe the same thing. So by the time I come across the same word again, enough time has passed that I could've forgotten about it completely, effectively starting all over again, or at least making the process much slower by leaving it up to luck.</p>
<p>However, if you can create a structure by yourself, you can also avoid this aspect of luck, and what's more, through science and how your brain works, you can optimize how quickly you learn your material; it's like creating a fitness program for your brain. Another benefit is that you'll prioritize what you want to remember automatically, because of how the system works. Of course, when you come across the same information more and more times, eventually you're not going to need to review it as much as before. The system that takes advantage of this based on scientific data is known as SRS, which stands for "Spaced Repetition System", and it's what makes sure that you won't study something too much, because your brain needs time to solidify that knowledge, and also that you'll study something enough to have a good chance of remembering it. The science behind this way of memorizing something is actually quite complicated, and because of that it's better implemented using computers; but if you're curious about all of those complicated details, you can learn form someone much more qualified to talk about it <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534678.3539081?cid=99660547150">here</a>.</p>
<p>While science and statistics for learning a language are great, they're still only half of what makes sentence mining so effective. The other half is context: to learn anything in a language, the context is the most important part. With context, instead of simply memorizing definitions, your brain starts to build up more and more associations for you automatically - instead of just knowing what something means, you'll know how it <em>fits</em>. This comes naturally with your first language, where you can look at a sentence and know if it "sounds off" in no time at all. Context also gives your mind a way to learn more effectively: instead of having to conjure up the meaning of something just based on that thing alone, you can recognize the context and figure out the meaning based on other clues that you remember, building more connections in your brain, and giving you something to fall back on if you ever forget a certain word or something else. With sentence mining, you can combine the two main ways that we all learned our first language: in part with school, and in large part just by listening to the same things again and again in their right contexts, eventually imitating those things ourselves when that context arises again. Of course, understanding the formal parts of a language with books or lessons can help us make sure that we'll talk with good grammar, or even to create new phrases that you've never heard before, but just imitating what you've heard many times can take you very far. More formal learning can help us to practice writing and talking with other people too, but if you don't have access to such a thing, there are many other ways to do so, especially in the age of the internet.</p>
<p>I should mention that sentence mining has proven especially useful for a language like Japanese for me because it's so different from my first language; with Spanish, while there are still a lot of different aspects compared to English, there's definitely things that are similar to English too, like the structure of sentences, or of course, cognates. But with Japanese, even though there are still some tiny bits that are shared with English or Spanish, almost everything seems completely different, in terms of writing, reading, speaking, and even with thinking of how to express something. Because of all these differences, constantly seeing words or phrases in the context of part of a conversation feels essential, because it allows me to stop relying on my knowledge of English in a way that otherwise, I would actually damage my understanding. For example, when I started learning Japanese, I wanted to know how to say "because"; since the words for this between English and Spanish are basically one to one, I thought that the answer would be simple, but really I had already made a mistake just by making these comparisons. </p>
<p>In Japanese, sentences don't follow a very strict order, but rather something called "particles" are placed after different parts of a sentence to show, for example, who is doing an action to what. In English, and also in Spanish and other European languages, we know who affects what in a sentence because of the order of the words. That is to say, we know the phrases, "the frog eats the fly" and "the fly eats the frog" are very different because of which words come first. The words "because" works with this system, showing us that the phrase after "because" is the reason for the phrase before it. However, this system of ordering words doesn't exist in the same way in Japanese, because of the aforementioned "particles", and therefore resulting in that there are many ways to say "because" in Japanese. I won't bore you with too many details, but that's just one example of why immersing yourself with context is so necessary in order to learn a language which is very different from your own. Even though utilizing your experience with another language can be useful with learning some languages, more completely relying on the context of your target language will help you gain an understanding of what it is to use that language like a native speaker, without having to translate from your first language every time. If you start to immediately recognize what to say in a certain context, the experience gets closer to something more like using your first language.</p>
<p>With that long introduction out of the way, we can talk more details. If any of the techniques described above sound useful to you, I'll show you the tools that I use daily for these techniques, as well as for improving language learning skills in general. I think the most important of these tools is something called Anki; this is the tool that'll organize everything that you want to remember from another language. At the same time, it's the key to managing when you're going to study what, following the SRS model for every item you study, in order to optimize how much you should study in one session like we talked about before. To download it and for information on how to configure it, I personally used <a href="https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#anki-setup">this guide</a> when I discovered sentence mining, and <a href="https://youtu.be/n-J8xXsWdkg?feature=shared">this video</a> was also very informative. These guides are targeted at those who want to learn Japanese, which applied to me at that time, but I've been able to apply them to learning Spanish as well, and in theory I think it's possible for any other language as well. In the case of Spanish, the only critical thing I needed to change was that I had to provide a different dictionary for "Yomitan" (a list of many different dictionaries for other languages can be found <a href="https://github.com/yomidevs/kaikki-to-yomitan/blob/master/downloads.md">here</a>, and you may be able to find more with your own search); with that done, if any word in your browser is from the language that you downloaded the dictionary for, the Yomitan will be able to tell you automatically what that word means, with examples and more.</p>
<p>This group of tools is most useful to help you get that little bit of progress each day, just by making it easier to achieve. Even though that might seem bad in terms of studying, given that we frequently equivocate hard work with actual learning, I believe it's actually good for two reasons. One is that it's important to be realistic; if you seriously want to start doing something every day in the midst of a busy life, first it's necessary to make it easy to achieve - then, you can add more from there. Of course, you can do exactly that just by spending more time using the same methods. Another reason is that this accessibility allows the language to insert itself in your life through things that you already experience every day, such as entertainment; this natural absorption, combined with the little time and effort required to carry it out, helps you to reinforce your learning every day. I believe that is what confirms that this is one of the most effective and most realistic methods to truly learn a language. </p>
<p>Another benefit of Anki and the tools related to it is that they're very popular - because of the communities surrounding them, there are a wide variety of ways to use them, and there are also a lot of information and guides out there that people have contributed to help others reach their goals. For example, a community that helped me a lot when I started with Japanese can be found at <a href="https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/">this site</a>, which practically provided me with everything I needed to start sentence mining, like a sample deck that contains the format that I still use for all of my flashcards. Because a lot of people start from this resource, there are a lot of videos or more articles about how to use Anki in many different contexts, which can be very useful if you need help with anything specific. Because Anki is very versatile as well, there are a lot of extensions that can personalize your studying experience, or even improve the experience for your target language overall, like those in the guides mentioned earlier; all you need to do is search for more information about these aspects, and you'll probably find everything that you would want.</p>
<p>Beyond Anki, there are other popular tools that I've tried, and personally, I haven't liked them as much as Anki for various reasons, but mainly, as we touched on earlier, because the context needed to learn more effectively isn't quite on par when it comes to these other tools. One of these tools is known as WaniKani, which is actually what I used to start learning Japanese even before Anki, so I have quite a bit of experience with it. I wouldn't say that it's all bad in terms of learning new words in Japanese, as it can be quite helpful with Kanji, but it's main method of teaching you, mnemonics, aren't as good in my opinion. I do think it could be more useful for other people, but for me, I felt that, especially if the given mnemonic didn't resonate with me, the mnemonics were really only extra information that I didn't need. </p>
<p>Of course, if you don't want to learn Japanese, you're not going to use WaniKani anyway, but I think that the idea applies to all languages: if you feel like using mnemonics helps you, use them, but if you can't notice a considerable difference, leave 'em. I think that it's incredibly difficult to create or remember a mnemonic for every little thing that you're going to learn in a language, even though they can be useful when something quickly comes to mind, more like an analogy, where you're simply making a connection to some strong knowledge that you already have. In other words, when you can make the most of something that you already understand well enough to relate it to the thing you're learning, some form of mnemonic that uses that knowledge can be very effective. But ultimately, a language is just arbitrary sounds and symbols that we've given meaning in order to communicate; there's not always more reasons or patterns behind their creation beyond that purpose, no different from any other arbitrary thing that we give meaning, like telephone numbers or zip codes. In that way, I think that it's totally okay if a lot of your language learning doesn't include a lot of reasoning behind it, or even if it's pure memorization. After all, it's probably true that for the majority of how you speak in your first language, you learned in the same way, without reasons or mnemonics for everything.</p>
<p>Another way to enjoy learning a new language, especially for me, is with video games or YouTube. In regard to video games, I actually discovered their potential usefulness by accident: one day, I was playing one of my favorites games, "Balatro", and I noticed a button to change the language of the game in the corner. Since then and even now, I only play that game in Spanish. I think that playing games in your target language is another great way to plant that language in your life naturally. In this case, there's also a lot of repetition if you play a game a lot, and the things that you'll learn will be very useful to you immediately, giving you more motivation to learn - to keep playing, you'll probably have to learn what the game is saying.</p>
<p>However, it is true that this method of learning has its limits, in more than one way. One is maybe more obvious, which is that the effectiveness of this method depends on how much you need to read or listen to language in order to play the game. Some games don't have much or even any words at all, and for other games it's possible that you already understand how to play without any written or verbal information. That takes us to the second point, which is that the effectiveness of this method will almost certainly diminish the more that you play. Except for certain types of games, at some point you'll play like an expert, without any need for directions or language in general. But up until that point, it can be a good way to learn that's both practical and fun. For those games that depend a lot more on dialogue, while they might seem like a perfect fit since you're less likely to run into the problem of being able to play without words, the lack of repetition for said dialogue will make it tough for any new material to actually stick. Just playing these kinds of games in another language is still better than nothing, but I think they're more suited to use with sentence mining. I haven't tried sentence mining with video games yet personally, but you can find more information in <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/vn/">this article</a>, complete with an example for visual novels in Japanese.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, another case where sentence mining is very accessible, fun, and useful is with YouTube. Once you have everything configured as we talked about above, you can immediately start watching YouTube as a part of your learning; the only thing that you need to change from how you already use it (if you watch YouTube almost every day like me) is finding some content in the language that you want to learn. If you want to take advantage of the algorithm, I would even suggest making a separate Google account just for finding that content, that way YouTube will only suggest you content in your target language on that account. And of course, make sure that you turn on subtitles in that same language, not only to improve your reading skills at the same time, but especially to work with the tools that we've been discussing. More specifically I think that you'll want to find videos with subtitles with a real author, which you can tell by going to the videos Settings (the cog icon in the bottom right of the video player) then Subtitles, then checking if the selected option says "auto-generated", but these days with all the advances in AI, most of the time automatic subtitles are quite good too.</p>
<p>If the scenarios above don't fit in with your daily life, I hope at least that they gave you all the inspiration and foundation that you need to create a personal environment and habits for yourself where language learning becomes a natural part of life. Remember, the most important thing is to make the learning experience enjoyable, just like everything else in your life that you keep doing again and again without literally needing to do that thing, like your other hobbies or going out with friends; don't let it turn into another job or chore. If it can become more like a hobby, something equal parts fun and gratifying, I'm certain that you're going to find success no matter what specific methods you use, the order you learn words or grammar concepts, or any other unnecessary details. At the end of the day, if you're having fun with something, there's probably a better chance you're going to remember it, and that fun will make you want to put in more effort and focus too. Then all the work you put in each day can become even more effective. So go and start doing something fun with languages, and take things slowly, but surely; after a while, you'll surprise yourself with your progress!</p>
