								<p>Exams are coming up soon, so I've had some difficulty keeping up the pace of work for my game, and I'm also looking to create assets as of now so I can be sure of how to implement environments around necessary animations and other things of that sort. I got to thinking again about what would make my game original and captivating, because I started to have doubts that one simple mechanic alone could provide enough nuance to really be fun and sustainable. I sorted out something along the lines of each tile on the corkboard being a printed photo, like a Polaroid, in which the contents of the image can interact with adjacent photos supernaturally, such as water from a photo of waterfall leaking out to fill a photograph of a dam. Of course, that example is on a very small scale, but my worries were somewhat relieved having thought of it, and I realized that the art style shouldn't restrict the gameplay, so I had to make a compromise on the fact that the art and mechanics bound to each other would both be realistic and fantastical in nature, even though initially I was hoping to make the experience more intuitive by having all mechanics tied to a wholly realistic art style. However, I also came to realize that the current movement system for the tiles would be unfeasible to look at with the final decision on the art, so I somehow worked around it in my head that I could use something like laundry clips that a photo hanging from a string moves between or has removed in order to move in a snappier fashion. Next, I'm going to implement enums into my manager scripts to make them more efficient to control from other classes, since that's what they're meant to do, and I also might dabble with a constructor for each of them to make them able to me initialized with a different target, level, or etc. more easily.</p>
