								<p>Admittedly, I've thought of this blog for a long time mostly as a step and utility for my career, as opposed to an outlet to talk about things that I'm proud of or that I enjoy, so even though both of those things are very true as far as my career path, I couldn't get around writing for this blog as a chore instead of something I was truly passionate about. Having an arbitrary requirement for when I should post made things feel especially arduous, even if writing every time I made progress on a project is incredibly useful for documenting my growth as a developer. In the time since my last post, I've graduated, started and stopped worked on many new projects, and in general have gone through a lot of significant life changes. It's still been very tough to keep up with the pace of life, but now that I've had a lot more free time and energy to focus on myself post-graduation, I've been happy and inspired to look inward and start progressing on a lot of the things I've felt like I've had to leave behind before, such as this blog, and approach them with a fresh set of eyes. In addition to starting small, like I tried to mention last time, I'm going to hold myself to only write about ideas that I'm excited about, and work them in with my progress on a given project if I can. I've also had a lot of fun teaching myself Spanish in the past year, so I can use this as another outlet to keep up my learning, even if my vocabulary still has ways to go. With all this in mind, even though my blog posts will still be dated, the date will refer to the date I finish them, even though each one will likely take several days of small bits of progress to complete. I want to keep to my word of starting small, along with the fact that I don't want this to be mixed in with some content that I don't want to be diluted, so I'll leave this post here, just to serve as a sort of marker and starting point. Look forward to more soon!</p>
