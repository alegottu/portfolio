								<p>After a very long hiatus, I've been inspired to once again continue logging my progress for my game development journey. Initially, this log was spurred on by the excitement of working on a new project with a friend, but looking back now, I've learned that I very quickly became burned out by setting the expectation for myself that I <strong>had</strong> to write about my progress each day. Not only did it feel awful when I just had those days when I hit a wall and just didn't have much to write about, but the amount of effort I had to put in to expect to work on and write about a project each day was mentally exhausting. After a while, my mental health couldn't keep up, and I pushed the idea away gradually until it faded from my goals completely. Now, I've learned a lot not only about game development, programming, and design, but also about myself. To learn from my mistakes and to make this log a habit, I'm going to start small: one post a month to start, perhaps while jotting down some quick topics to remember for later. It's easy to want to jump in and go full speed ahead towards your goals; it seems like the best course of action at the moment, and we frequently idealize this impossibly motivated version of ourselves where we make a drastic change in our lives instantly by sheer willpower. Similarly, it's much harder to trust yourself to commit to something long-term, to something that won't yield many results at first, and initially won't do much to quell whatever emotions inspired your goal in the first place. But if I truly want to make a habit, I have to start from zero and build my way up gradually. I can't just expect to be a hardened expert right away.</p>
<p>That said, I do want to take some time to actually talk about game development, and what I've learned there in the past two years. The biggest breakthrough I've made as a developer actually has nothing to do with programming, and everything to do with hardware. As a game developer, efficiency is important, not only if you want your game to feel as good as possible, but also if you want your game to reach as many people as possible - not everyone has the luxury of a high-end PC. At first, as I'm sure is the case with most programmers, I worked to make my code efficient only at the high level. If I could condense two for loops into one, I would do it. If a data structure could give me the same result in less lines, I would do it. But in terms of actually speed, I had no idea what I was actually doing. In the programming community, "beautiful" or "clean" code is put up on a pedestal as though writing code is purely an art form. In some ways, it can be, but we also can't forget that code, at the end of the day, is functional. What it looks like is important for other developers (including our future selves) but the priority is the result, and content widely available online, as well as how I learned, would suggest the opposite. As engineers, programmers, or whatever you consider yourself as a game developer, you have to be aware of the fact that the machines you work with are not magical boxes who speak a programming language. They have limitations and specific procedures for processing data which results in what we see on our screens and how we can interact with them. There is nothing wrong with hobbyists, or newer and intermediate programmers not understanding this, but I think to be a professional programmer means to understand what the words you write are actually doing to your computer. Not necessarily to the extent where you could build a CPU from scratch, but at least a surface level knowledge of how your code works under the hood.</p>
<p>The realization that I actually had no idea what my code was doing led me to the paradigm of data oriented design, which I'm currently working on embedding into a project for a fighting game that uses both traditional 2D fighting game mechanics like from street fighter, and, well, rocket jumping. Along the path of this pursuit, I've also learned more about what individual statements, operators, and functions do to my CPU and memory, and how different types of data are stored to try and make the best possible solutions for efficiency. I know I can't expect myself to always make the perfect decision the first time, however, so I've also learned that testing is the best habit a game programmer can have. I can never assume the first solution I try is the fastest, and the only thing that can tell me what's faster is a real speed test. In my new game, one of my biggest challenges so far has been understanding entity component systems from a data oriented perspective. So far I've managed to efficiently accomplish gravity for all entities with a rigidbody, or rather for all rigidbodies, but I'm working on a solution for providing an ID for entities, as there is now more of a need for an entity's components to be grouped together, whereas before I could work on each component array mostly individually. My next biggest challenge has been understanding frame rate on a low level, where allowing your frame rate to be unlimited causes complications with your physics updating consistently. By manually controlling a separate physics loop instead, your rendering loop will consistently be ahead of the physics, or in the rare case of a very slow frame rate, the opposite. Controlling for both of these cases requires that you can approximate the state of your game to be rendered in either direction, depending on which loop is ahead of the other, so that there are no visual artifacts.</p>
<p>It's been a ton of fun engaging with my code on an entirely different level than before, although I do have to be careful to always balance between getting something done and paying attention to the finer details. That being said, getting rid of any black boxes you have surrounding how your program works, whether it be how it compiles, why the language its in is the way it is, or whatever other lingering questions you may have had in the background, I 100% recommend exploring them! </p>
