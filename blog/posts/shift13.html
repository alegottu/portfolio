								<p>After getting caught up in a somewhat brutal workflow for college, I'm happy to say that I'm revisiting this project, not necessarily to finish it, but to allow myself to take a proper retrospective, take some lessons learned, and appreciate how far I've come. Since entering college, I've shifted my focus to becoming a better programmer first and a better designer second. That being said, looking back on this project, it's hard to tell where the design of this game was going, and I calmly recognize now that perhaps we fell into the classic blunder: starting too big. Ultimately the core part of this game just doesn't seem as fun as we initially thought, as its central identity is unclear, and a bit clogged with lots of fun but admittedly secondary ideas. In better news, in the same vein as focusing on the core of what makes something fun, my decision to choose programming and ultimately choose what makes game development the most exciting for me has led me to realize just how much I didn't actually know as a programmer back then, despite the naive attitude I held, and despite this being such a short time ago. In the same way you look back at your younger self in photos and cringe, in a strange way it feels good being able to be proud of where I am now.</p>
<p>One such example of my naïveté as a younger developer was my attempt with a save system towards the time when I stopped working on this game. I had always wondered how they work, so I decided to take a shot at figuring it out myself. Admittedly, I could have indulged in some basic research first, but I can still appreciate my eager initiative that has developed into a more health philosophy now: start with the bare minimum using what you know, and build on top of that as you find out what the project's more complex needs are. It's always a very fulfilling experience realizing just how much you can actually build from scratch with your pure intuition and experience combined; certainly not something to wholly rely on, but definitely a valuable tool to derive your own valuable techniques and information. That being said, in this instance, I took belief in one part of my own knowledge alone too far, even though it seems so obvious now. I attempted to create a save system practically using enums alone - a technique I was very excited to put into use at the time, but that distracted me from a much simpler answer. Even though I used enums to represent the state that the player has reached along with an object that persists between scenes, this of course only actually works while you test the game within the editor itself. My experience up to that point was entirely within Unity, and I just hadn't considered that the software I was creating with it would actually exist on hardware with an operating system that allows that program to be shut down entirely. Once you realize that, you know the answer is simple: if the program will close, create something that will stay even if it does - a file. My experience with general programming as well as a bit of engine programming up to this point has helped me figure out not only just how naive this blunder was but also the importance of hardware and systems outside your own software in general. Knowing the environment that you are programming for leads to higher performance and a greater understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. Without that knowledge, the devices you are programming on and for truly are just black boxes. </p>
