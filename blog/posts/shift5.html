								<p>Being able to see a vision for my game certainly becomes a lot easier once I actually achieve smoother input. I've encountered the problem several times when input seems to only register half the time, not only because I've put some code in the wrong update loop, but because of complete disarrays with unnecessary logic variables, often created in attempt to fix the inputs in the first place. I've now also encountered problems with simple counters to have an input accomplish a different action after a certain amount of presses. Since I had the tutorial level nearly done, I wanted to tackle cleaning up these issues as soon as possible. I went at it for a good hour while trying to finish up the movement for the tiles, and in scrapping both the clamping system and reversing increments for the tiles to move back and forth for a certain amount of steps, I found the same solution to my problems as before: fundamentals. Instead of using a clamping system, I used a yet another counting system which counted each time a tile moved a space due to the player pressing the button on the level. However, the order of the counter integer being increased turned out to be extremely important, as a simple tertiary statement allowed it to be reset when it was past its max, but if the integer was increased before the tertiary, one direction of the movement would get more steps. As for the logic of when to reverse the movement for a certain amount of steps, I just doubled the variable that indicated the maximum number of moves the tile could make in one direction, and then finally reset the counter back to zero once it was equal to the limit variable doubled. Once the counter was greater than the limit variable but less than double that same variable, the direction switched to allow the tile to move back and forth the same amount of steps by pressing a button. For the first time, I feel like all the arithmetic and algebra that everyone preaches for computer science actually came intuitively to my problem-solving, and I felt quite satisfied for being able to make the logic clean, and not relying on extra states or any other extraneous data.</p>
<p>When it came down to the input that wasn't responding half the time, the improved tile movement saved it as far as pressing the button. However, when the player wanted to view the larger portion of the level with the workstation, it seemed to work only about 80% of the time. At first, I tried to add a forgiveness state on the "use" button that would save if the player pressed the "use" while near an object or if it was held down for a long time, but I realized I had to go back to basics again. I decomposed the method that changed the camera's culling mask, gave it a parameter for any element that could be changed to observe those changes, and put it by itself in the update function for extra responsiveness. I had succeeded decomposing methods for tile movement, so I figured I should do the same for the camera, and everything worked out for the workstation mechanic. Although, while the method for the workstation was originally in the fixed update game loop, it was only calling on a boolean which was activated in the player's script by input in its update loop, not by receiving actual input again, so I'll have to look further into why it wasn't originally responsive. In addition, however, I managed to make the trigger portions of the player script much simpler by only having a helper game object/script changed based on exiting and entering triggers, that way comparisons can be made in other scripts respectively. Overall, I couldn't be more content with my progress.</p>
