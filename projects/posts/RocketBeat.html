						<p>I started working on this project as a way to practice what I had recently learned on data-oriented design, as opposed to object-oriented design, and as a way to take the sort of low-level thinking more seriously by developing this game in C++ from scratch, only using a multimedia library. As I've matured more as a developer, I've realized it's important to pay close attention to the performance as your code, as the quicker it runs, the better and more equal of an experience everyone can have with your game. Especially for fighting games, fair play and healthy competition are paramount and breed thriving communities, so even if I have to take the long way around, I want to find a way to do this one right. For now, the project is only a skeleton of SDL2 code, made to support rocket physics, frame data, and much more later. Even though right now there is only a small foundation for the game I hope to create, it's an idea I'm very passionate about; like I mentioned in my post on [[Bootsies]], fighting games are one of the greatest joys of my life, and I personally want to bring more of those unique, competitive, and enduring experiences and communities to more people in whatever ways I can! Although I can't speak too much on it yet because I don't want to reveal too many details, you can be sure to expect exciting news in the future!</p>
