						<p>Here are some scripts I've made and my configuration files for common Linux applications if you're curious or want some inspiration! Over the years, I've tried a lot of different tools for writing, building, and working with code, and ultimately I've come to prefer a lot of tools featured on Linux. In my opinion, command line tools, the best of which tend to be on Linux, are the best balance of lightweight and powerful. While text-based programs are often thought of as basic, in the context of programming, they are both efficient and universal. On one hand, if you are able to perform the same actions you can in some programs with a few clicks instead with a few keystrokes, you'll be able to work much faster. Another aspect is that if a program uses both text as input and produces text as output, you can easily combine it with other text-based tools to create your own even more powerful tools. There are a couple of examples of this within the repository I'm sharing here. </p>
<p>Although it may not be as important to other developers, the lightweight aspect of development tools on Linux has always really appealed to me. Since we do live in an age where computers are far more advanced than they were even a few years ago, I can definitely understand why other developers are willing to use more bulky pieces of software, but personally I really enjoy that I can have access to my development environment on basically any system. That's part of why I have this repository in place, so that if I'm ever stuck without my laptop or desktop and there's an alternative device that I can use, I can easily get things set up how I like them just by cloning this repository and quickly installing the right programs on Linux, whether natively on that system or through a virtual machine. I've also been able to stick with my desktop for a very long time, I think in large part due to the very low requirements of my favorite tools. If any of that appeals to you, I highly recommend taking a dive into Linux and tools like Vim, Neovim, grep, bash, and many more. While I can admit getting things configured exactly how you like can be a time-consuming process, there are lots of resources out there to give you a head start, and hopefully you can enjoy a lot of the power behind the personalization along the way.</p>
